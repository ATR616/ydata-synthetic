# Synthetic data GANs playground

This repository contains material related with Generative Adversarial Networks for synthetic data generation,
in particular regular tabular data and time-series. 
It consists in a set of different GANs architectures developed ussing Tensorflow 2.0. An
example Jupyter Notebook is included, to show how to use the different architectures.

##### In this repo you can find the following GAN architectures:
- [GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)
- [CGAN (Conditional GAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784)
- [WGAN (Wasserstein GAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875)
